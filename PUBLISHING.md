3. **Multi-language embedding** - Use Python, JavaScript within SUB
4. **Zero learning curve** - Familiar concepts, simple patterns
5. **MIT licensed** - Truly open source

### Target Audiences
1. **Beginners** - Easy to learn first language
2. **Indie developers** - Quick cross-platform prototypes
3. **Educators** - Teaching programming concepts
4. **Researchers** - Experimenting with language design
5. **Open source enthusiasts** - Contributing to compilers
